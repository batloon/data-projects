Coffee Happiness Analysis - Distribution Report
==========================================

This analysis examines the relationship between coffee consumption and happiness scores across countries.

Criteria:
- High Coffee Consumption: ≥2.0 kg per capita/year
- High Happiness Score: ≥6.0 on the happiness scale

Distribution Analysis:
--------------------
1. Countries with Both High Coffee & High Happiness:
   - These countries represent the "sweet spot" where high coffee consumption
     and high happiness levels intersect
   - Percentage: {both_pct:.1f}% of all countries

2. Countries with High Coffee Only:
   - These countries have high coffee consumption (≥2.0 kg) but lower happiness scores (<6.0)
   - Percentage: {coffee_only_pct:.1f}% of all countries

3. Countries with High Happiness Only:
   - These countries achieve high happiness scores (≥6.0) despite lower coffee consumption (<2.0 kg)
   - Percentage: {happiness_only_pct:.1f}% of all countries

4. Neither High Coffee nor High Happiness:
   - Remaining countries that don't meet either threshold
   - Percentage: {100 - (both_pct + coffee_only_pct + happiness_only_pct):.1f}% of all countries

Coffee Consumption Categories:
---------------------------
- Exceptionally High: ≥14.0 kg per capita/year
- Very High: ≥6.0 kg per capita/year
- High: ≥3.0 kg per capita/year
- Moderate: ≥1.0 kg per capita/year
- Low: ≥0.5 kg per capita/year
- Very Low: <0.5 kg per capita/year

Key Insights:
------------
- The analysis uses a threshold of 2.0 kg per capita/year for coffee consumption,
  allowing us to capture a broader range of coffee-drinking nations
- The happiness threshold of 6.0 represents a significantly positive level of
  national happiness on the scale
- The overlap between coffee consumption and happiness suggests potential cultural,
  economic, or lifestyle factors that might influence both metrics
- Many countries achieve high happiness without significant coffee consumption,
  indicating that coffee is not the sole contributor to national happiness
- Some high coffee-consuming countries don't report high happiness scores,
  suggesting other factors play important roles in determining happiness levels

Note: This analysis is based on the latest available data and should be interpreted
considering various cultural, economic, and social factors that influence both
coffee consumption patterns and happiness scores.
