   - Japan: Moderate consumption (3.58 kg) with moderate happiness (6.147)

7. Economic Implications:
   - Higher coffee consumption generally aligns with stronger economies
   - Developed nations show both higher consumption and happiness
   - Price sensitivity might affect consumption in developing nations

Recommendations for Further Analysis
----------------------------------
1. Time series analysis to track changes over years
2. Economic indicator correlation (GDP, disposable income)
3. Coffee price impact analysis
4. Cultural factor analysis
5. Coffee shop density correlation
6. Coffee type preferences by region
7. Climate impact on consumption patterns

Limitations
----------
1. Sample size (52 countries) could be expanded
2. Data might not capture informal coffee consumption
3. Cultural differences in coffee preparation not considered
4. Happiness score methodology limitations
5. Economic factors not directly controlled for

This analysis provides strong evidence for a correlation between coffee consumption and happiness, though causation cannot be definitively established. Cultural, economic, and social factors likely play significant roles in both metrics.
